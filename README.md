Using Pandas library I loaded the dataset and also check the complete information about the dataset using the same library. since the data is having lot of Null values I am going to take help of statistics concept to clean the data and if my approach was not a good way for doing this Project Please let know. But while focusing on Missing values I got it know Last 2 rows are completely NAN so I removed the last 2 Rows.

After removing last 2 rows the data becomes quite good where only 2 columns having null values and remaining things are solved:

       - Collect the data
       
       - check the data information
       
       - split the data
       
       - training operations should be done on test data [Just Keep in Mind]
       
       - Handle Missing values if There
       
       - EDA Part [Exploratory Data Analysis]
       
       - Checking Normal Distribution
       
       - Checking Outliers
       
       - Handling them
       
       - Handle Cateogorical data
       
       - Transformation Techniques
       
       - select best features for both numerical and categorical data
       
       - Model developement
       
       - check validation
       
       - Evaluate model
       
       - check AUC and ROC For selecting Best Model
       
       - Hyperparameter tuning on the top of the best model
       
       - Save the model
       
       - Read the Model and check once again
